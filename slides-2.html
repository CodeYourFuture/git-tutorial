      <h3>"Forking" a project</h3>
        <p>Forking a project copies it to your GitHub account. In a way,
        it is equivalent to cloning it.</p>
      <h3>Why "forking"?</h3>
        <p>Forking gives you the ability to work on the project and modify
        it according to your needs without interfering with the original
        project.</p>
        <p>This is useful if you want to adapt it for something specific,
        if the original project is no longer active, or... if you want to
        contribute back to them</p>

      <h3>Contributing!</h3>
        <p>The ability to contribute is the most important feature of
        GitHub.</p>
        <p>Different people can work on different aspects of a same
        project, working at their own speed, and then they can deliver
        their changes or improvements</p>
        <p>This is done using Pull Requests</p>

    <section class="slide slide-four">    
      <h3>Pull Requests</h3>
        <p>Allows the receiving project to review the changes before incorporating them</p>
        <p>Allows automatically integrating these changes</p>

    <section class="slide slide-five">    
      <h3>Good practices</h3>
        <p>Keep your master branch pointing to the original project's master branch</p>
        <p>Work on feature branches</p>
        <p>Submit Pull Requests from feature branches</p>
        <p>Keep feature branches up to date</p>
