    <h2>Using GitHub</h2>
    <h3>"Forking" a project</h3>
    <p>Forking a project copies it to your GitHub account. In a way,
      it is equivalent to cloning it.</p>
    <h3>Why "forking"?</h3>
    <p>Forking gives you the ability to work on the project and modify
      it according to your needs without interfering with the original
      project.</p>
    <p>This is useful if you want to adapt it for something specific,
      if the original project is no longer active, or... if you want to
      contribute back to them</p>
    <h3>Contributing!</h3>
    <p>The ability to contribute is the most important feature of
      GitHub. Different people can work on different aspects of a same
      project, working at their own speed, and then they can deliver
      their changes or improvements</p>
    <p>This is done using Pull Requests</p>
    <h3>Pull Requests</h3>
    <p>Allows the receiving project to review the changes before incorporating them</p>
    <p>Allows automatically integrating these changes</p>
    <h3>Good practices</h3>
    <p>Keep your master branch pointing to the original project's master branch</p>
    <p>Work on feature branches</p>
    <p>Submit Pull Requests from feature branches</p>
    <p>Keep feature branches up to date</p>
