				<h3>"Forking" a project</h3>
					<p>Forking a project copies it to your GitHub account. In a way, it is equivalent to cloning it.
					</p>
				<h3>Why "forking"?</h3>
					<p>Forking gives you the ability to work on the project and modify
			it according to your needs without interfering with the original
			project.
					</p>
					<p>This is useful if you want to adapt it for something specific,
			if the original project is no longer active, or... if you want to
			contribute back to them

				<h3>Contributing!</h3>
					<p>The ability to contribute is the most important feature of
			GitHub. Different people can work on different aspects of a same
			project, working at their own speed, and then they can deliver
			their changes or improvements</p>
					<p>This is done using Pull Requests</p>
				<h3>Pull Requests</h3>
					<p>Allows the receiving project to review the changes before incorporating them
					</p>
					<p>Allows automatically integrating these changes</p>

				<h3>Good practices</h3>
					<p>Keep your master branch pointing to the original project's master branch</p>
					<p>Work on feature branches</p>
					<p>Submit Pull Requests from feature branches</p>
					<p>Keep feature branches up to date</p>
